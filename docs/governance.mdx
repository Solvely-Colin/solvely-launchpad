# Governance Checklist

Governance mixes repository settings, process contracts, and issue operations.

## Beta support policy

- support channel: GitHub Issues
- scope: Launchpad onboarding, reusable workflow integration, and preset fit
- response target: best effort within 72 hours
- escalation: prioritize `setup-blocker` before additional outreach

## Issue triage model

Required labels:

- `setup-blocker`
- `preset-gap`
- `docs-gap`
- `quality-gate`

Label definitions source:

- [`.github/labels.yml`](../.github/labels.yml)

## Branch protection baseline (`main`)

Required checks should include:

- self-test fixtures/matrix
- primary caller CI check

Recommended settings:

- require pull request before merge
- require status checks to pass
- block direct pushes to `main`

## Secrets and credentials

For npm release publishing:

- set `NPM_TOKEN` repository secret

For quality gates requiring attestations/security uploads:

- ensure caller workflow permissions include required scopes

## Release governance

Release flow:

1. create tagged release (`vX.Y.Z`)
2. preflight validates required secrets
3. reusable publish executes
4. release notes and artifacts are available

## External repo setup constraints

For forks and org-protected repos:

- grant `contents: write` and `pull-requests: write` where setup PR is expected
- allow bot branch creation
- if not allowed, run CLI locally and open a manual PR

## Reliability gate before broad launch

Before broad promotion:

- rolling 7-day fixture pass rate >= 95%
- no unresolved `setup-blocker` older than 72 hours

## Weekly ops checklist

- review open blockers and stale issues
- update reliability/adoption metrics
- decide outreach volume based on support load
- publish one short weekly status note
