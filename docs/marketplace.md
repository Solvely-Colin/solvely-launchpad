# Marketplace Positioning (Week 3)

## Goal

Publish Launchpad positioning with explicit `@v1` stability contract and proof artifacts.

## Listing copy (ready)

Short description:

- 30-second CI/CD baseline for OSS maintainers with reusable workflows pinned to `@v1`.

Long description:

- Solvely Launchpad helps OSS repositories replace copy-pasted workflows with a stable `@v1` reusable CI contract.
- Includes one-command setup (`init`), policy-as-code, aggregated PR summaries, and optional security gates.
- Designed for maintainers who want faster onboarding and consistent CI behavior across repos.

## Week 3 checklist

- [ ] Confirm reliability gate trend is healthy (>=95% pass over 7 days)
- [ ] Publish/verify demo repos (node-lib, nextjs, turbo)
- [ ] Update badges and README proof links
- [ ] Publish marketplace-facing metadata and copy
- [ ] Post evidence-based launch update with adoption metrics

## Contract language to keep consistent

- Use `@v1` in all production examples
- State that `v1.x` is semver-stable
- Route migration guidance to `docs/migrations/v1.md`
