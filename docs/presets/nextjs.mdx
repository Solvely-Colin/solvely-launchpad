# Preset: nextjs

Best for Next.js applications and sites.

## Generated workflows

- `ci.yml`
- `coverage.yml`
- `scheduled.yml`

## Typical command

```bash
npx solvely-launchpad init --preset nextjs --yes
```

## Notes

- Release workflow is not included by default for app-style repos.
- Add quality gates separately when needed via reusable `quality-gates.yml`.
