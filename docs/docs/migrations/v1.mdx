# Migration Guide: v1

## Semver contract

- `v1.x` introduces additive features and non-breaking defaults.
- Breaking changes are reserved for `v2`.

## Recommended migration

1. Replace `@main` with `@v1` in reusable workflow references.
2. Add `.citemplate.yml` with `version: 1` and your selected preset.
3. Run:

```bash
npx solvely-launchpad migrate --from v1 --to v1.x
```
