# Migration Guide: v1

This guide standardizes existing repos onto the `@v1` contract.

## Contract summary

- `v1.x` is additive and non-breaking
- breaking changes are reserved for `v2`
- policy keys unknown to v1 produce warnings, not hard failures

## Migration checklist

1. replace reusable refs pinned to `@main` with `@v1`
2. ensure caller permissions baseline exists
3. add `.citemplate.yml` with `version: 1` and selected preset
4. run doctor to catch drift

## CLI path

```bash
npx solvely-launchpad migrate --from v1 --to v1.x
npx solvely-launchpad doctor
```

## Caller baseline template

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
```

## Post-migration validation

- CI caller runs green
- no `@main` refs remain in workflows
- optional gates are intentional and documented
