# Reliability Dashboard

Reliability is measured from [`self-test-matrix`](../.github/workflows/self-test-matrix.yml).

## Core metrics

- fixture pass rate
- median runtime per fixture
- flaky failures per week

Recommended SLOs:

- pass rate >= 99%
- flaky rate <= 1%
- median fixture runtime <= 5 minutes

## Launch gate (beta)

Require both:

- rolling 7-day self-test pass rate >= 95%
- no unresolved regression in core fixtures (`node-lib`, `nextjs`, `turbo`)

## Weekly collection process

Run:

```bash
./tooling/metrics/update-weekly.sh 2026-02-16
```

Then:

1. inspect latest 7 runs of self-test matrix
2. record pass/fail counts and runtimes
3. flag flaky failures (rerun passes with no code change)
4. append weekly record

## Weekly table

| Week (UTC) | Runs | Pass Rate | Median Runtime | Flaky Incidents | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| 2026-02-16 | 100 | 100.00% | 0.37 min | 0 | Baseline populated from workflow data on 2026-02-18 |

## Response policy for regressions

- open issue for failing fixture family
- classify severity and blast radius
- patch same day for high-impact setup regressions
- update docs or preset defaults when root cause is onboarding friction
