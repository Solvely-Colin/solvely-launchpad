# Troubleshooting

Use this page to recover quickly from first-run friction and keep rollout momentum.

## Setup workflow did not open a PR

Check:

- repository Actions permissions include `contents: write` and `pull-requests: write`
- branch policies allow bot branch push and PR creation
- setup workflow run logs for token/permission errors

## First CI run failed during install

Symptoms:

- install step fails despite valid lockfile
- monorepo workspace resolution fails
- no root lockfile in app/service repo

Fix:

- set `with.install-command` explicitly in caller workflow
- choose deterministic command (`npm ci`, `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, etc.)

## Release workflow was not generated

Expected when:

- repository has no `package.json`
- init used `--app true` or `--no-release true`

If release is required, rerun init for a package repo shape or add release workflow manually.

## Policy check failed

Common issues:

- missing `version` or `preset`
- invalid `checks.security.audit_level`

Valid `audit_level` values:

- `critical`
- `high`
- `moderate`
- `low`

## Preset auto-detection chose wrong target

CLI falls back to `node-lib` when uncertain.

Use explicit preset to avoid mismatch:

```bash
npx solvely-launchpad init --preset PRESET_ID --yes
```

## Commitlint behavior is not what you expected

Strict failures:

- enable Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`)
- if migrating legacy repo, start with non-strict and move to strict later

Warnings without failing CI:

- this is default mode (`strict: false`)
- switch by setting `--commitlint-strict true` at init time

## Dependency review did not run

This is expected outside `pull_request` context.

- `push`, `release`, and `workflow_dispatch` runs will skip dependency review
- check quality-gates summary for explicit skip reason

## SLSA provenance failed

Ensure caller workflow has:

- `id-token: write`
- `attestations: write`

Then rerun.

## CodeQL failed during autobuild

Fix pattern:

1. add explicit build/setup before analysis
2. ensure dependencies install in CI
3. rerun after build command is stable

## Scorecard SARIF upload failed

Check:

- `security-events: write` permission in caller workflow
- repository visibility/access compatibility for scan

## Doctor reports warnings

Run:

```bash
npx solvely-launchpad doctor
```

Interpretation:

- warnings are actionable drift indicators
- baseline missing files can be hard failures
- fix warnings before broad rollout to reduce support load

## Escalation path

If a blocker persists after these fixes:

1. open issue with label `setup-blocker`
2. include caller workflow, error excerpt, and repo shape
3. include whether failure is CLI path or workflow-dispatch path
