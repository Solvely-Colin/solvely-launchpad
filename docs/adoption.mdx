# Adoption Dashboard

Primary KPI: `external_repos_on_v1`.

## KPI set

- `external_repos_on_v1`
- `setup_pr_merge_rate`
- `time_to_first_green_ci`
- `weekly_active_repos`
- `issues_response_sla_met`

## Definitions

- `external_repos_on_v1`: external repos referencing Launchpad reusable workflows at `@v1`
- `setup_pr_merge_rate`: merged setup PRs / opened setup PRs per reporting week
- `time_to_first_green_ci`: median elapsed time from setup PR open to first green CI
- `weekly_active_repos`: adopted repos with at least one Launchpad run in last 7 days
- `issues_response_sla_met`: issues with first maintainer response within 72 hours

## Sources of truth

- GitHub code search for `uses: ...@v1`
- outreach/setup PR tracker
- GitHub Issues timestamps
- self-test reliability overlap data

## Machine-readable files

- [`docs/metrics/adoption-weekly.json`](./metrics/adoption-weekly.json)
- [`docs/metrics/reliability-weekly.json`](./metrics/reliability-weekly.json)

Keep files append-only by week.

## Weekly ritual

Run:

```bash
./tooling/metrics/update-weekly.sh 2026-02-16
```

Workflow:

1. collect latest 7-day data for all KPIs
2. append adoption weekly JSON record
3. append reliability weekly JSON record
4. add short interpretation note
5. tune outreach volume based on blocker load

## Solo operator guardrails

- cap outreach when unresolved `setup-blocker` grows
- prioritize onboarding fixes over net-new promotion if first-green time regresses
- optimize for real `@v1` usage, not stars/traffic

## Owner checklist

- [ ] update adoption weekly JSON
- [ ] update reliability weekly JSON
- [ ] review open blocker issues
- [ ] set next-week outreach cap
- [ ] publish weekly learnings note

## Weekly notes

- 2026-02-16 week: baseline week initialized; collection process defined.
