# Deprecation Policy

Deprecations are managed to keep adopter migration predictable.

## Rules

- deprecations are announced in release notes and docs
- each deprecation keeps at least two minor releases of overlap before removal
- `v1` schema remains compatible across all `v1.x` releases
- unknown `.citemplate.yml` keys warn in `v1.x` (no hard failure)

## Deprecation lifecycle

1. announce deprecation and preferred replacement
2. keep legacy behavior active through overlap window
3. provide migration guidance and examples
4. remove in next major or after explicit policy window

## Consumer guidance

- pin reusable workflows to `@v1`
- run `doctor` during upgrades
- treat warnings as migration backlog, not ignorable noise
